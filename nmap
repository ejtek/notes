# NMAP

**Basic port scan**
This scans the most common 1000 ports on the target.
nmap <target>

**OS detection scan**
This enables OS detection, version scanning, script scanning, and traceroute.
nmap -A <target>

**Version scanning**
This probes open ports to determine service/version info.
nmap -sV <target>

**Stealth/SYN scan**
This performs a TCP SYN scan, which is relatively unobtrusive and stealthy.
nmap -sS <target>

**UDP scan**
This scans for open UDP ports.
nmap -sU <target>

**Ping scan (host discovery)**
This performs a ping scan to discover live hosts without port scanning.
nmap -sn <target>

**Specific port scan**
This scans specific port(s) on the target.
nmap -p <port(s)> <target>

**Aggressive scan**
This sets the timing template to "aggressive", speeding up the scan.
nmap -T4 <target>

**Script scan**
This uses the default Nmap scripts for scanning.
nmap -sC <target>

**Verbose output**
This increases the verbosity of the output.
nmap -v <target>

**Save output to file**
This saves the scan results in normal format to a file.
nmap -oN <filename> <target>

**Fast scan**
This scans fewer ports than the default scan for quicker results.
nmap -F <target>
