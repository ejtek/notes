Basic port scan:
nmap <target>
This scans the most common 1000 ports on the target.

OS detection scan:
nmap -A <target>
This enables OS detection, version scanning, script scanning, and traceroute.

Version scanning:
nmap -sV <target>
This probes open ports to determine service/version info.

Stealth/SYN scan:
nmap -sS <target>
This performs a TCP SYN scan, which is relatively unobtrusive and stealthy.

UDP scan:
nmap -sU <target>
This scans for open UDP ports.

Ping scan (host discovery):
nmap -sn <target>
This performs a ping scan to discover live hosts without port scanning.

Specific port scan:
nmap -p <port(s)> <target>
This scans specific port(s) on the target.

Aggressive scan:
nmap -T4 <target>
This sets the timing template to "aggressive", speeding up the scan.

Script scan:
nmap -sC <target>
This uses the default Nmap scripts for scanning.

Verbose output:
nmap -v <target>
This increases the verbosity of the output.

Save output to file:
nmap -oN <filename> <target>
This saves the scan results in normal format to a file.

Fast scan:
nmap -F <target>
This scans fewer ports than the default scan for quicker results.
