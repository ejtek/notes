# Apache

```
In Arch Linux, Apache configuration files are located in `/etc/httpd/conf`. The main configuration file is `/etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf`, which includes various other configuration files. The default configuration file should be fine for a simple setup. By default, it will serve the directory `/srv/http` to anyone who visits your website.
